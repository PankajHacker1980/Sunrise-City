Sunrise City

Sunrise City is an interactive website that changes its look and feel based on the time of day and the live weather
The idea came from a personal memory of watching the city come alive in the morning and fall quiet in the evening and I wanted to capture that feeling in a digital space

This project is more than just code it started with a real street that felt different every morning and every evening some days it felt like spring other days like autumn or winter Sunrise City tries to recreate that mood by turning live data into light color and motion
